## Installation

There are several options to install the service menus listed in this repository.

### From Dolphin

All of them are available at the [KDE store][kde_store] and in the connected sites
([Opendesktop][opendesktop], [Pling][pling]), that way the installation can be
easily performed using the proper Dolphin interface available among the settings:

> Settings > Services > Download new Services

Just fill up the text box with the service name and, once found, install it from that interface.

### Downloading the archive from Pling

The compressed archive can be downloaded from Pling or the other twin websites, and can be used in two ways:
- extracting it and running the `Makefile` included;
- using the `servicemenuinstaller` command;
- extracting it and manually copy the files.

Let see them in details.

#### Makefile

So after extracting the archive:
```
$ tar -xvf <archive-name.tgz>
```

And entered the folder:
```shell
$ cd <project_folder>
```

The following command can be launch to install the service menu:
```shell
$ make install
```

To remove the service, from within the same folder:
```shell
$ make uninstall
```

#### Servicemenuinstaller

This is a Dolphin utility which automatically install the archives downloaded by Pling.
```shell
$ servicemenuinstaller install <archive-name.tgz>
```

To uninstall it must use the same archive and run the command:
```shell
$ servicemenuinstaller uninstall <archive-name.tgz>
```

#### Manual install

To install a service manually, if not otherwise advised, it's just easy as copying the *.desktop*
file under the local folder:

- KDE 4: *~/.kde4/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/*
- KDE 5: *~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/*

### From the GitHub repository

Once cloned the repository locally:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/fabiomux/kde-servicemenus.git
```

Enter the project folder:
```shell
$ cd kde-servicemenus
```

Build the archive for the wanted project using as name the related folder:
```shell
$ make <project_name>
```

Install it using the *Dolphin* utility:
```shell
$ servicemenuinstaller install <archive-name.tgz>
```

You can use the same archive to uninstall the service if not needed:
```shell
$ servicemenuinstaller uninstall <archive-name.tgz>
```
